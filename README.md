## SkimLit NLP Deep Learning Model
Based on the paper "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071.pdf)
Project done inline with course TensorFlow Developer Certificate 2021: Zero to Mastery

# Description
Deep learning NLP model used for sequential sentence classification of medical paper abstracts.
Classifies the sentences of a medical paper's abstract in to the following classes:  background, objective, method, result, or conclusion.
Makes use of transfer learning (Universal Sentence Encoder: https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4).
Includes:
- Data batching and prefetching techniques to optimize model training.
- Feature Engineering
- Model experimentation and validation
